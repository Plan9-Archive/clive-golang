The golang.git repo at git.lsub is a 
	git clone -bare https://go.googlesource.com/go

To create a clone for you, you should:
	git clone git@git.lsub.org:Public/git/golang.git golang

The clone at /zx/sys/golang added google as a remote to pull go changes
	git remote add upstream https://go.googlesource.com/go
You may ignore this.

There are two branches: master and lsub.
	- master: this should be kept untoched.
	This is meant to be the same code pulled from google.
	- lsub: this is the lsub version of the go compiler

See the branch you are in (flagged with a star):
	git branch

Pull changes:
	git fetch origin master	# fetch new google changes
	git fetch origin lsub		# fetch new lsub changes

Make changes:
git checkout -b my-branch	# create a branch for you

# repeat as many times as you want (all of them are in your branch)
git add .
git commit -m msg
git push origin my-branch

# Now merge your hanges with master
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge my-branch

# and push the changes back
git push

# you might delete the tag for your branch
git branch -d guide

# force a checkout of a version
git checkout -f fd18fff3efacbb6af603e39fd0ea29ce231145c0
